            <h2>About Smart Savings Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                Smart Savings Tracker is a simple app for recording money you
                <strong>saved by not spending it</strong> — for example, “decided not to buy” or
                “didn’t go out today” and so on. You can record dates, categories, amounts, and memos,
                and review your savings on a calendar, in totals, and with graphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also set multiple savings goals, track your progress toward each one, and
                optionally register “planned amount” and “return rate” for lottery or gambling-related
                savings so the app can calculate the saved amount automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app works offline and stores all savings records locally on your device.
                A one-time premium upgrade removes ads and unlocks extra features such as iCloud
                backup, passcode lock, and CSV export.

            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Smart Savings Tracker is an application for recording and reviewing your savings
                history (money you chose not to spend). The app is designed to work without any user
                account, and all savings data you enter is stored locally on your device by default.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                The app itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally
                identifiable information on external servers. Specifically, the app does not send
                the following data outside your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dates and amounts of each savings entry</li>
                <li>Category names you select or register</li>
                <li>Memos or notes you enter</li>
                <li>Savings goals, target amounts, and related notes</li>
                <li>Settings for return rate or planned amounts for gambling-related entries</li>
                <li>Any other savings records you create within the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All records you create remain on your device only.
                The developer cannot view or access this data.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Exception: Google AdMob (Free Version Only)</h3>
            <p>
                The free version of Kantan Smart – Savings Log uses Google AdMob to display
                advertisements. AdMob may automatically process certain data for purposes such
                as ad delivery, frequency capping, and measurement. This can include example
                data such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advertising ID (IDFA)</li>
                <li>Approximate location</li>
                <li>Basic ad interaction data (for example, impressions or clicks)</li>
                <li>Device information (model, OS version, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These data are processed by Google or its partners, not directly by the
                developer of this app. For details, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    https://policies.google.com/privacy
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you upgrade to the premium version, in-app banner ads are removed from the app UI.
                However, Google’s SDK may still be present in the app binary.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Savings Data and Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
                All data you enter in the app – including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dates and amounts of savings</li>
                <li>Categories (such as food, daily items, transport, gambling, etc.)</li>
                <li>Memos or descriptions for each entry</li>
                <li>Savings goals, target amounts, and progress</li>
                <li>Return-rate–based calculations for lottery or gambling-related entries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                is stored only on your device’s local storage.
                This information is not automatically backed up or uploaded to any server
                by this app.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Backups (iCloud Drive and Files)</h3>
            <p>
                Smart Savings Tracker provides a backup feature that allows you to create
                backup files and save them using the system Files interface (for example,
                iCloud Drive or other storage locations).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Backup files are created on your device and saved to the location you choose
                    (such as iCloud Drive) via Apple’s Files app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    These backup files may contain your savings data (entries, goals, settings, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The backup data is stored in your own storage account; the developer does not
                    operate any server for backups and cannot access your backup files.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you restore from a backup, the existing data in the app may be overwritten.
                This operation is performed locally on your device.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Permissions</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on your usage, Smart Savings Tracker may request access to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Files / iCloud Drive</strong> – when you choose to create or restore
                    a backup using the system Files picker.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These permissions are used only for the intended features within the app.
                The app does not upload your savings data to any external server operated by
                the developer.
            </p>

            <h3>7. In-App Purchases</h3>
            <p>
                Smart Savings Tracker offers a one-time premium upgrade
                (non-consumable purchase). All purchase processing is handled entirely by
                Apple’s App Store via StoreKit. The app itself does not access or store any
                payment information such as credit card numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Premium features may include, for example:
            </p>

                <li>Enabling backup-related features (such as iCloud Drive backups)</li>
                <li>Enabling passcode lock to protect your privacy</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>8. Passcode Lock and Biometric Authentication</h3>
            <p>
                The app provides an optional passcode lock and may support biometric
                authentication (such as Face ID) to protect your savings data on the device.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Passcodes are stored securely on the device using iOS mechanisms.</li>
                <li>Passcodes and biometric data are not sent to any external server by this app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Please note that if you forget your passcode and have not set up biometric
                unlock, you may not be able to access your data from within the app.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>The following third-party services are used by the app:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> – for displaying advertisements in the free version.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple StoreKit</strong> – for processing in-app purchases.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Apple iCloud / Files</strong> – when you choose to save or restore backup
                    files using iCloud Drive or other locations via the Files app.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These services may collect technical or advertising-related data under their own
                privacy policies. Please refer to each provider’s official documentation for
                detailed information.
            </p>

            <h3>10. Data Sharing</h3>

                <li>Transfer your savings data to external servers managed by the developer</li>
            </ul>
