            <h2>About Gift Note – Present Tracker</h2>
            <p>
                Gift Note – Present Tracker is a simple app for recording gifts you have <strong>received</strong> and
                <strong>given</strong>. You can register people, occasions (such as birthdays, weddings, seasonal
                gifts, etc.), gift items, amounts, shops, notes, and photos, and look back on all of them in a
                clean, scrollable timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app works offline and stores all gift records locally on your device.  
                A one-time premium upgrade removes ads and unlocks higher limits and extra features.

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Gift Note – Present Tracker is an application for managing and reviewing gift records.
                The app is designed to work without any user account, and all gift data you enter is stored
                locally on your device.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                The app itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable
                information on external servers. Specifically, the app does not send the following data outside
                your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Names of people you register</li>
                <li>Event titles (e.g. “Mom’s birthday”, “Wedding gift”)</li>
                <li>Gift item names</li>
                <li>Amounts or currencies you enter</li>
                <li>Shop or store names</li>
                <li>Notes or memos</li>
                <li>Photos attached to gift records</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All records you create (including photos) remain on your device only.  
                The developer cannot view or access this data.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Exception: Google AdMob (Free Version Only)</h3>
            <p>
                The free version of Gift Note – Present Tracker uses Google AdMob to display advertisements.
                AdMob may automatically process certain data for purposes such as ad delivery, frequency capping,
                or measurement. This can include example data such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advertising ID (IDFA)</li>
                <li>Approximate location</li>
                <li>Basic ad interaction data (for example, impressions or clicks)</li>
                <li>Device information (model, OS version, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These data are processed by Google or its partners, not directly by the developer of this app.
                For details, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:

                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you upgrade to the premium version, in-app banner ads are removed from the app UI.
                However, Google’s SDK may still be present in the app binary.
