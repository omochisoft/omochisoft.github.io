            <h2>About Fridge Inventory: Grocery Cost</h2>
            <p>
                Fridge Inventory: Grocery Cost is a simple app that helps you
                <strong>log groceries</strong> and <strong>visualize what’s in your fridge</strong>.
                You can record items with details such as ingredients, quantity, price, purchase date,
                and store, then review your fridge inventory and shopping history anytime.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you log ingredients used for cooking, the app can update your remaining inventory
                and automatically calculate the <strong>ingredient cost per meal</strong>.
                You can also review spending trends with easy-to-read charts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is designed to work without creating an account. By default, your records are
                stored locally on your device. A premium upgrade removes ads and unlocks additional
                features such as category editing, CSV export, and iCloud backup/restore.

            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Fridge Inventory: Grocery Cost is an application for recording and reviewing grocery
                items, fridge inventory, and ingredient costs. The app is designed to work without any
                user account, and the data you enter is stored locally on your device by default.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>
                The app itself does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personally
                identifiable information on external servers operated by the developer.
                In particular, the app does not send the following data outside your device:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grocery items you enter (ingredient names, quantities, and units)</li>
                <li>Prices, purchase dates, and store names</li>
                <li>Cooking logs (meal info, used ingredients, calculated costs)</li>
                <li>Notes, memos, and custom category names</li>
                <li>Charts and totals derived from your records</li>
                <li>Any other records you create within the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All records you create remain on your device unless you choose to export or back up.
                The developer cannot view or access your local data.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Exception: Google AdMob (Free Version Only)</h3>
            <p>
                The free version of Fridge Inventory: Grocery Cost uses Google AdMob to display
                advertisements. AdMob may automatically process certain data for purposes such as ad
                delivery, frequency capping, fraud prevention, and measurement. This can include
                example data such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advertising Identifier (IDFA) or other device identifiers (depending on your settings)</li>
                <li>Approximate location (for example, inferred from IP address)</li>
                <li>Basic ad interaction data (such as impressions or clicks)</li>
                <li>Device information (model, OS version, language, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These data are processed by Google or its partners, not directly by the developer of
                this app. For details, please see Google’s Privacy Policy:
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    https://policies.google.com/privacy
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                If you upgrade to the premium version, in-app ads are removed from the app UI.
                However, Google’s SDK may still be present in the app binary.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Your Data and Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
                All data you enter in the app — including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Shopping logs (items, quantities/units, prices, dates, store names)</li>
                <li>Fridge inventory and remaining quantities</li>
                <li>Cooking logs and calculated ingredient costs</li>
                <li>Notes, photos you attach to records (if applicable), and settings</li>
                <li>Categories (default or customized)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                is stored only on your device’s local storage by default.
                This information is not automatically uploaded to any server operated by the developer.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Backups and Restore (iCloud / Files)</h3>
            <p>
                Fridge Inventory: Grocery Cost provides a backup feature that allows you to create
                backup files and save them using the system Files interface (for example, iCloud Drive
                or other storage locations).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Backup files are created on your device and saved to the location you choose
                    via Apple’s Files app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Backup files may contain your app data (shopping logs, cooking logs, settings, etc.).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The developer does not operate any server for backups and cannot access your backup files.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you restore from a backup, existing data in the app may be overwritten.
                This operation is performed locally on your device.
            </p>

            <h3>6. CSV Export</h3>
            <p>
                The app may allow you to export your records (for example, cooking logs and costs) as a
                CSV file so you can analyze the data in tools like Excel.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSV files are generated on your device.</li>
                <li>You choose where to save or share the exported file via the iOS share sheet.</li>
                <li>The developer does not receive your exported data.</li>

                library (Photo Library Add access).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Photo Library (Add Only)</strong> – used only to save images you choose to
